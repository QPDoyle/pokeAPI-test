                This website was created as a project for CS1080 at the University of Vermont.
                It was created by Ellie, Quinn, and Kyle.
                It is a tool that allows you to search for Pokemon cards by name.
                In order to properly use the search function, you must spell the name of the pokemon correctly! 
                Once you have entered the name of the pokemon you'd like to search for, press the search button!
