# Poke-Search!

## Instructions to run the POKE-API:

#### Create an account through this link, and get an API key:
-   **https://dev.pokemontcg.io/**
-   IMPORTANT: paste your personal API key into line 5 of app.js
#### How to run the code: 
-   To run ANYTHING you need to be in the server director and is easiest to do through terminal, 
-   i.e..   \root\desktop\CS1080\POKEAPI-TEST\Server (different depending on where you clone the repo).
-   Once in server dir nodemon SHOULD already come installed if it correctly moves w/ the repo (if not text GC I can help with package setups), run the following command:
**npx nodemon app.js**
-   Then to see the website side paste the following into your browser **http://localhost:3000/**
- This will show the front end info of the card being displayed, to see the back end add **/card** to the browser.

#### Helpful Info/Links:
-   This uses nodejs which is a launguage built around java script and there are many helpful tutorials on YT.

## Website Description
This website is meant to be used so that you can just search up a pokemon and see a bunch of its cards. We have a home, which shows our current favorite card, a search tab, where you can look up your pokemon, and an about section. 

## How we made the website
Ellie, Kyle, and Quinn all came into the project with a fondness for pokemon cards, and thought that it would be  a good challenge to figure out how to make a website that lets you look up pokemon cards by name.

Quinn proceeded to go full Jimmy Neutron and write about 100,000 lines of code in order to figure out how to connect a pokemon API with our website's search bar.

This was crazy.

Kyle and Ellie, being Animal Science and Communications majors, respectively, both decided to focus more on the CSS and HTML side of the website. 

Ellie worked on the site design, the nav bar, and the about page. She thought it would be cute to make all of the team members as little sprites.

Kyle worked on the intro page, little hover animations, and everyone's favorite cards!
