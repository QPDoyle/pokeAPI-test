## Instructions to run the POKE-API:

#### Create an account through this link, and get an API key:
-   **https://dev.pokemontcg.io/**
-   IMPORTANT: paste your personal API key into line 5 of app.js
#### How to run the code: 
-   To run ANYTHING you need to be in the server director and is easiest to do through terminal, 
-   i.e..   \root\desktop\CS1080\POKEAPI-TEST\Server (different depending on where you clone the repo).
-   Once in server dir nodemon SHOULD already come installed if it correctly moves w/ the repo (if not text GC I can help with package setups), run the following command:
**npx nodemon app.js**
-   Then to see the website side paste the following into your browser **http://localhost:3000/**
- This will show the front end info of the card being displayed, to see the back end add **/card** to the browser.

#### Helpful Info/Links:
